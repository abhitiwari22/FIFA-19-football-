About the Dataset
This dataset contains features of around 18,000 football players. Using only numerical attributes to cluster the data.
Data Visualization and Data Preparation

I have  used matplotlib and seaborn for visualization.
For my  comfort, below mentioned are the basic visualization I have started with:
Plot histogram of count of players based on some attributes like height.
 Plot histogram and kde plots on attributes like ‘Value’ and ‘Wage’
 Use visualization techniques to find outliers like Ronaldo and Messi
 Distribution of players in different clubs/countries on the basis of some attributes
 Data transformations:
 Remove inconsistencies from ‘Value’ and ‘Wage’ columns
 Missing Values and Outliers treatment
